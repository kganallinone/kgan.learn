# 🔪 How to Kill a Running Localhost Server

This guide shows you how to kill a process running on a specific port (like `localhost:3000`) using the terminal.

---

## 🖥️ For macOS / Linux

### 🔍 Step 1: Find the Process Using the Port

Replace `3000` with your actual port:

```bash
lsof -i :3000
```
````

You’ll see output like:

```
COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE ...
node     12345  yourname  ...
```

### ❌ Step 2: Kill the Process

Use the PID from the output above:

```bash
kill -9 12345
```

---

## 🪟 For Windows

### 🔍 Step 1: Find the Process Using the Port

Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and run:

```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
```

Output:

```
TCP    127.0.0.1:3000   0.0.0.0:0   LISTENING   12345
```

### ❌ Step 2: Kill the Process

Use the PID from the previous step:

```bash
taskkill /PID 12345 /F
```

---

## ⚙️ If `taskkill` Doesn't Work (Windows)

### ✅ 1. Run as Administrator

- Right-click **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**
- Choose **"Run as administrator"**
- Run the `taskkill` command again.

### ✅ 2. Kill All Node.js Processes (if applicable)

If you're running a Node.js server and don’t mind stopping all Node instances:

```bash
taskkill /IM node.exe /F
```

### ✅ 3. Use Resource Monitor (GUI Method)

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open **Task Manager**
2. Go to **Performance** → click **Open Resource Monitor**
3. Under **Network → Listening Ports**, find your port (e.g., 3000)
4. Right-click the process → choose **End Process**

---

## ✅ Success!

Your localhost server should now be terminated and the port should be free for reuse.
